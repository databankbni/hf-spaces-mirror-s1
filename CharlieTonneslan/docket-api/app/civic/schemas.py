"""Civic domain records + HTTP request/response contract.

Two layers live here, mirroring AwardGuard's ``models.py`` convention:

  * plain in-process records (``CivicDocument``, ``CivicChunk``) that flow
    between ingest / retrieval / answer;
  * Pydantic models that define the wire contract for the civic routers.

The Postgres *tables* themselves are defined as SQL in ``app.civic.db`` — this
module holds only the Python-side shapes. Kept separate from the existing
``app.schemas`` (tasks/users) so the two slices never collide.
