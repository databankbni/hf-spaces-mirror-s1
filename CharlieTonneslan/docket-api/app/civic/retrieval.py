"""Hybrid retrieval over civic_chunks: dense (pgvector) + lexical (tsvector) + RRF.

The load-bearing search algorithm, adapted from AwardGuard's
``backend/app/core/retrieval.py``. In one breath:

    Pure semantic search (embeddings) is great at "this means the same thing" but
    can miss exact civic terms (a bill number, a body name). Pure lexical search
    (Postgres full-text) nails exact terms but is blind to paraphrase. We run
    BOTH over ``civic_chunks``, then combine the two rankings with Reciprocal Rank
    Fusion (RRF) — a simple, robust, score-scale-free merge.

Domain adaptation from AwardGuard: retrieve over ``civic_chunks`` (keyed by chunk
id) instead of ``sections``; hydrate results back to their parent
``civic_documents`` (file_no + title) so the answer layer can cite bills.

The ``reciprocal_rank_fusion`` function is PURE (lists in, list out) so it is
unit-tested with no DB / network / LLM — see tests/test_civic_rrf.py.
