"""Cite-or-refuse synthesis + independent citation verification.

Adapted from AwardGuard's ``backend/app/core/answer.py``. The contract:

    The LLM sees ONLY the retrieved civic chunks and must cite every claim to a
    retrieved document — using its bill/file number, e.g. ``[Bill 260633]`` — or
    refuse with a fixed phrase. After the model responds we INDEPENDENTLY verify
    every citation against the retrieved set: a citation the model invents (a
    file_no not in the retrieved chunks) is dropped, and an answer with no
    surviving citations is treated as a refusal. This double-check is what makes
    the grounding trustworthy even if the model misbehaves.

Domain adaptation from AwardGuard: citations key off Legistar ``file_no`` (the
bill/matter file number) instead of eCFR ``section_id``, so the citation regex,
the system-prompt rules, and the context block all speak in bills, not sections.
Provider dispatch (Ollama default, Anthropic optional) and the graceful-failure
handling are reused as-is.

The pure helpers (``extract_citations`` / ``verify_citations``) are unit-tested
with no network/LLM — see tests/test_civic_citations.py. The LLM call is isolated
so any transport/API failure degrades to a graceful refusal instead of a crash.
