"""Insight aggregates over the civic corpus (no LLM, pure SQL).

Two read-only views the ``/civic/insights`` routes expose:

  * ``corpus_overview`` — a quantitative snapshot: how many Matters, broken down
    by type and by legislative status, monthly introduction volume, and the date
    span covered. Answers "what is in here and how active is Council?".
  * ``topic_activity`` — bill counts for a CURATED set of policy topics
    (housing, zoning, transit, ...), optionally since a date. This is the
    "legislation on tracked topics" view: unsupervised term-frequency over civic
    text is dominated by procedural boilerplate, so we count against a hand-built
    topic->keyword map instead, which is interpretable and stable.

All heavy lifting is SQL aggregation over ``civic_documents`` / ``civic_chunks``;
these functions are thin and DB-backed so they unit-test with a mocked cursor.
