"""Ingest pipeline: fetch Legistar Matters -> normalize -> chunk -> embed -> upsert.

Source: the Legistar Web API for Philadelphia City Council. VERIFIED live
(2026-07) against the real endpoint before this module was written:

    Base:    https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{client}/          (client = "phila")
    Matters: GET /v1/phila/Matters                             -> 200, JSON array.
             OData query options confirmed working against the live API:
                 $top      page size (server caps large values)
                 $skip     offset -> stable paging when combined with a TOTAL $orderby
                 $orderby  e.g. "MatterIntroDate desc,MatterId desc" (recent first,
                           MatterId tiebreak forces a total order for stable paging)
                 $filter   e.g. "MatterIntroDate ge datetime'2026-01-01'"

    A Matter looks like (fields we keep) -- confirmed against real records:
        MatterId          -> source_ref (upsert key)   e.g. 27386   (int)
        MatterFile        -> file_no                    e.g. "260633" (str, the
                                                        human bill number we cite)
        MatterName        -> (null on recent records; we fall back to MatterTitle)
        MatterTitle       -> title / chunk text         (the substantive text; on
                                                        real records this is a
                                                        multi-paragraph body, which
                                                        is why chunking earns its keep)
        MatterTypeName    -> doc_type                   e.g. "COMMUNICATION"
        MatterStatusName  -> status                     e.g. "PLACED ON FILE"
        MatterIntroDate   -> intro_date                 e.g. "2026-06-11T00:00:00"
        MatterBodyName    -> body_name                  e.g. "CITY COUNCIL"

The whole pipeline is idempotent: we upsert on ``source_ref`` (the MatterId) so
re-running refreshes rows in place rather than duplicating. Chunks are rebuilt
(delete-then-insert) on every upsert so a Matter whose text changed upstream can
never leave stale chunks behind.

Structure adapted from AwardGuard's ``backend/app/core/ingest.py`` (fetch /
parse / upsert / orchestrate), swapping the eCFR XML source for paginated
Legistar JSON and the single ``sections`` table for the
``civic_documents`` + ``civic_chunks`` split.

This module is LOAD-BEARING and is heavily commented on purpose.
