"""
Model registry — the Day-3 bake-off families, packaged for production.

Every model exposes ``predict_fold(prices, fold, ctx) -> np.ndarray`` of
``fold.test_len`` predicted next-day RETURNS, fitting strictly on
``prices[:fold.train_end]`` (the walk-forward contract from
``src.backtest.walkforward``). ``ctx`` comes from :func:`make_context` and
carries shared precomputations (returns, dates, features) so ten models on the
same series don't rebuild them ten times.

The registry order reflects the Day-3 leaderboard: ``arima`` is the champion
among forecasting models (Sharpe 1.34 net of costs), but the honest headline
stays what it was — none of them beats buy-and-hold (1.83), and persistence
(r̂ = 0) is the RMSE floor every candidate must justify itself against.
