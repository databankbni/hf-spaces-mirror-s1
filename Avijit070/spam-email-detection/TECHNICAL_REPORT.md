## Abstract

This project presents a production-grade spam and phishing email detection system employing a dual-track ensemble architecture that combines classical machine learning (XGBoost) with transformer-based deep learning (DeBERTa-v3). The system processes emails through a 5-layer detection pipeline — whitelist, trusted catalog, rule-based detection, benign context guard, and ML classification — before reaching the ensemble for final prediction. The classical track leverages TF-IDF vectorization with 32 engineered meta-features and evaluates three candidate models (SGDClassifier, XGBoost, LightGBM) with Optuna hyperparameter optimization available as an optional training mode. The transformer track fine-tunes DeBERTa-v3 with focal loss, FGM adversarial training, and curriculum learning. The two tracks are fused via weighted late fusion with a grid-searched fusion weight optimized for spam F1. The system is deployed as a Chrome extension for Gmail with a FastAPI backend, includes 225 deterministic tests covering all production modules, and supports Docker-based deployment with SHA-256 integrity verification. This report documents the complete methodology, experimental design, engineering decisions, and lessons learned from building and deploying the system.

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 Background

Email spam and phishing remain among the most prevalent cybersecurity threats. According to industry reports, phishing attacks account for over 90% of data breaches, and the average organization receives hundreds of targeted phishing attempts daily. Traditional rule-based spam filters struggle against sophisticated social engineering attacks that use natural language, personalization, and context-aware deception to bypass detection.

### 1.2 Challenges

Spam detection presents several interconnected challenges:

- **Evolving attack patterns**: Spammers continuously adapt their tactics — from obvious keyword stuffing ("FREE MONEY") to sophisticated impersonation and context-aware phishing
- **Class imbalance**: Spam typically represents 10-30% of email volume, requiring models that maintain high recall without sacrificing precision
- **Real-time constraints**: Users expect sub-second classification latency for inbox integration
- **Explainability**: Users need to understand *why* an email was flagged — black-box predictions erode trust
- **Production robustness**: A deployed system must handle missing artifacts, corrupted models, concurrent requests, and adversarial inputs without crashing

### 1.3 System Requirements

The system was designed to meet the following requirements:

| Requirement | Target | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Spam F1 score | ≥ 0.95 | Competitive with commercial spam filters |
| Inference latency | < 100 ms per email | Non-blocking Gmail integration |
| Explainability | Top-4 contributing features per prediction | Actionable user feedback |
| Production readiness | Docker, env-based config, health checks | Deployable without code changes |
| Test coverage | 100% of production modules | Audit-verifiable quality |
| Model integrity | SHA-256 verification on load | Detect tampered/corrupted artifacts |

---

## 2. Dataset Analysis

### 2.1 Data Source

The training dataset contains **342,178 emails** with balanced spam/ham distribution. The dataset is expected to be in CSV format with two columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `label` | string or int | `spam`/`ham` or `1`/`0` |
| `text` | string | Full email body text |

### 2.2 Data Characteristics

The dataset exhibits the following characteristics common to real-world email corpora:

- **Length variation**: Emails range from single-line phishing lures to multi-paragraph newsletters
- **Language**: Primarily English, with some code-switching and non-English spam
- **Structured tokens**: URLs, email addresses, phone numbers, and currency amounts embedded in text
- **HTML content**: Many spam emails contain HTML with hidden elements, obfuscation, and tracking pixels
- **Obfuscation techniques**: Homograph attacks (Cyrillic 'а' looks like Latin 'a'), zero-width characters, Unicode tricks

### 2.3 Preprocessing Strategy

Standard NLP preprocessing (lowercasing, stopword removal) is applied with two critical deviations:

1. **Structured token preservation**: URLs, emails, phones, and money amounts are replaced with typed tokens (`urltoken`, `emailtoken`, `phonetoken`, `moneytoken`) rather than being stripped. This preserves the *presence* of these signals while removing the specific values.
2. **Spam-signal word preservation**: Words with high spam correlation (free, win, urgent, cash, offer, click, verify, account, limited, etc.) are exempted from stopword removal.

No stemming or lemmatization is applied — morphological variations often carry classification signals (e.g., "verifying" vs "verified").

### 2.4 Limitations

- The dataset represents a snapshot — spam patterns evolve, and the model requires periodic retraining with fresh feedback
- Non-English spam may not be adequately represented
- The dataset may contain temporal biases if collected during specific campaigns

---

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 5-Layer Detection Pipeline

Before reaching the ML system, every email passes through four deterministic layers that provide fast, interpretable decisions:

| Layer | Detection Method | Confidence | Fallthrough Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Whitelist** | Exact sender domain match in user's whitelist CSV | 1.0 | ~95% |
| **Trusted Catalog** | Exact/subdomain match in curated list of known services | 0.97 | ~85% |
| **Rule-Based Spam** | ≥2 phishing phrases OR ≥1 phrase + ≥2 indicator signals | 0.86–0.99 | ~70% |
| **Benign Context** | Conversational wording, no links/urgency/attachments | 0.82 (conv), 0.76 (promo) | ~60% |
| **ML Ensemble** | XGBoost + DeBERTa-v3 late fusion | 0.00–0.99 | 100% of remaining |

The first four layers handle obvious cases instantly (~0.1 ms). The ML model — the most computationally expensive component — only activates for emails that pass through all deterministic layers (~40-60% of volume in typical inbox scenarios).

### 3.2 Feature Engineering

The system extracts **32 meta-features** across six categories:

#### URL Analysis (6 features)
- `url_count`, `url_unique_domains`, `url_shortened`, `url_ip_address`, `url_suspicious_tld`, `url_to_text_ratio`

#### HTML & Hidden Content (3 features)
- `html_tag_count`, `html_hidden_element`, `html_hidden_size`

#### Text Quality (11 features)
- `exclamation_count`, `question_count`, `caps_ratio`, `digit_ratio`, `symbol_ratio`, `word_count`, `avg_word_length`, `flesch_reading_ease`, `type_token_ratio`, `imperative_verb_ratio`, `percent_hits`

#### Obfuscation Detection (2 features)
- `homograph_hits`, `unicode_obfuscation`

#### Attachment Indicators (2 features)
- `attachment_indicator`, `attachment_extension`

#### Phishing & Spam Signals (8 features)
- `credential_harvesting`, `spam_phrase_hits`, `urgency_hits`, `account_hits`, `call_to_action_hits`, `money_count`, `phone_count`, `promotional_hits`, `business_context_hits`

These features are extracted from the raw text (before preprocessing) to preserve obfuscation signals that would be lost during tokenization. The feature vector is combined with TF-IDF word n-grams into a sparse CSR matrix for the classical models.

### 3.3 Track A: Classical Machine Learning

#### Vectorization

TF-IDF vectorization produces weighted word n-gram features from the preprocessed text:

| Parameter | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `max_features` | 25,000 | Dimensionality cap to manage sparsity |
| `ngram_range` | (1, 2) | Unigrams + bigrams — "verify account" captures more signal than either word alone |
| `sublinear_tf` | True | `1 + log(tf)` dampens word frequency dominance |
| `max_df` | 0.5 | Ignores terms appearing in >50% of documents (corpus-specific stopwords) |
| `min_df` | 2 | Ignores hapax legomena (noise) |

The feature matrix is a sparse horizontal stack of the TF-IDF matrix (25,000 columns) and the meta-feature matrix (32 columns).

#### Candidate Models

Three classifiers are trained and evaluated as candidates:

**SGDClassifier** — Linear model with stochastic gradient descent. Serves as a fast, interpretable baseline. Supports hinge loss (linear SVM) and modified Huber loss variants with L1/L2/elasticnet regularization.

**XGBoost** — Gradient-boosted trees. The primary classical model for its ability to capture non-linear feature interactions, built-in sparsity awareness, and regularized objective function that prevents overfitting on the high-dimensional TF-IDF space.

**LightGBM** — Leaf-wise gradient boosting. Faster training than XGBoost on large datasets due to gradient-based one-side sampling (GOSS) and exclusive feature bundling (EFB). Often achieves comparable F1 in less time.

#### Hyperparameter Optimization

Optuna performs Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) sampler:

- **30 trials** per candidate model
- **20-minute cumulative timeout** per candidate
- **5-fold stratified cross-validation** per trial
- **Objective**: Maximize mean spam F1 across folds
- **Median pruner**: Terminates trials with below-median intermediate scores

Hyperparameter search spaces for XGBoost:

| Parameter | Search Range | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `n_estimators` | 100–500 | int |
| `max_depth` | 3–10 | int |
| `learning_rate` | log-uniform(0.01, 0.3) | float |
| `subsample` | 0.6–1.0 | float |
| `colsample_bytree` | 0.6–1.0 | float |
| `min_child_weight` | 1–10 | int |
| `gamma` | 0–5 | float |
| `reg_alpha` | log-uniform(1e-8, 1.0) | float |
| `reg_lambda` | log-uniform(1e-8, 1.0) | float |

#### Candidate Selection

After HPO, each candidate is evaluated on the 20% holdout set. The best candidate is selected by **spam F1 score** — accuracy and ROC-AUC are tracked as secondary metrics. The winning model (typically XGBoost) advances to the ensemble stage.

### 3.4 Track B: Transformer Fine-Tuning

#### Model Selection

**DeBERTa-v3-base** (Microsoft, ~184M parameters) was selected as the primary transformer model. Its disentangled attention mechanism separates content and position embeddings, enabling the model to learn richer semantic representations — particularly valuable for phishing detection where token position carries signal (e.g., "click here to verify" vs "verify and then click here"). DeBERTa-v3's ELECTRA-style replaced token detection pre-training produces better representations for classification than masked language modeling alone.

Alternative models (RoBERTa, ELECTRA, ModernBERT, DistilBERT, BERT-base) are supported as configurable training options.

#### Training Configuration

```python
TransformerConfig(
    model_name="microsoft/deberta-v3-base",
    epochs=3,                          # Curriculum: easy samples epoch 1
    batch_size=8,                      # VRAM-probed, adjusts automatically
    gradient_accumulation_steps=8,     # Effective batch = 8 × 8 = 64
    learning_rate=2e-5,               # Standard fine-tuning LR
    warmup_ratio=0.1,                 # Linear warmup over 10% of steps
    weight_decay=0.01,                # AdamW regularization
    max_length=256,                    # Truncation limit
    fp16=True,                         # Mixed precision training
)
```

#### Focal Loss

Standard cross-entropy treats all examples equally, causing the model to focus on easy examples that dominate the loss gradient. Focal loss addresses this:

```
FL(p_t) = -α_t (1 - p_t)^γ log(p_t)
```

Where:
- **α = 0.25**: Class weight — reduces majority class (ham) contribution
- **γ = 2.0**: Focusing parameter — well-classified examples (p_t > 0.9) are down-weighted by (0.1)² = 0.01

The effect is that training focuses on hard examples — borderline spam/ham cases that provide the most learning signal. This is critical for spam detection where the difference between aggressive marketing and phishing is subtle.

#### FGM Adversarial Training

The Fast Gradient Method adds worst-case perturbations to token embeddings during training:

```
ε = 0.5  (perturbation magnitude)
α = 0.3  (step size)
δ = ε · sign(∇_x L(x, y))  (perturbation direction)
L_adv = L(x + δ, y)         (adversarial loss)
```

This makes the model robust against adversarial text modifications — synonym substitution, character-level perturbations, invisible Unicode characters — which spammers use to evade detection. The perturbation is applied only to token embeddings (not position or token type embeddings).

#### Curriculum Learning

Training difficulty increases progressively:
- **Epoch 1**: Easiest 50% of samples (short texts, high rule-based confidence)
- **Epochs 2+**: All samples

This helps the model establish a strong baseline on clear-cut cases before tackling ambiguous examples, improving final convergence quality and reducing training time.

#### VRAM-Probed Batch Sizing

The optimal batch size is determined automatically:
1. Start with `batch_size = 32`
2. Run a trial forward + backward pass
3. If CUDA OOM → halve; if successful → try 1.5×
4. Converge to the largest stable batch size
5. Adjust `gradient_accumulation_steps` to maintain effective batch = 64

This eliminates manual tuning and adapts to available GPU memory.

### 3.5 Ensemble Strategy

#### Late Fusion

The ensemble uses weighted late fusion of Track A and Track B probabilities:

```
p_spam = w · p_classical + (1-w) · p_transformer
```

Where `w` ∈ [0.0, 1.0] is the fusion weight.

#### Fusion Weight Optimization

The optimal `w` is found by grid search:
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 in 21 steps (0.00, 0.05, 0.10, ..., 1.00)
- **Metric**: Spam F1 on holdout set
- **Special cases**: w=0.0 → transformer-only; w=1.0 → classical-only

Both models' predictions on the holdout set are "out-of-fold" — the classical model uses cross-validation OOF predictions, and the transformer uses validation-split predictions. This prevents overfitting the fusion weight to data either model has memorized.

#### Why Not Stacking?

A meta-classifier (stacking) was considered but rejected because:
- **Limited holdout data**: Training a meta-classifier on 20% of the dataset risks overfitting
- **Interpretability**: A single scalar weight is trivially interpretable — stacking produces opaque meta-decisions
- **Marginal gain**: On benchmark tasks, a trained meta-classifier rarely improves F1 by more than 0.5% over grid-searched weighted fusion

## 4. Experiments & Results

### 4.1 Experimental Setup

- **Dataset split**: 80/20 stratified (random seed fixed for reproducibility)

### 4.2 Classical Model Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Spam F1 | ROC-AUC | Train Time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SGDClassifier | 90.73% | 91.56% | 97.92% | 52.1 s |
| LightGBM | 98.23% | 98.28% | 99.86% | 394.4 s |
| **XGBoost** | **98.29%** | **98.33%** | **99.86%** | **1,226 s** |

> **Final Kaggle results** (June 16, 2026): Three classical candidates evaluated with default hyperparameters (Optuna HPO skipped via `--skip-optuna` to stay within Kaggle's 9-hour interactive session limit) on the full 342,178-row dataset. XGBoost selected as the classical ensemble branch. Optuna HPO (30 trials, 20-min timeout) is available for training on new datasets. Training time measured on Kaggle T4 GPU environment.

### 4.3 Transformer Model Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Spam F1 | ROC-AUC | Train Time | Model Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DistilBERT | — | — | — | — | 67 MB |
| ELECTRA | — | — | — | — | 110 MB |
| RoBERTa | — | — | — | — | 125 MB |
| **DeBERTa-v3** | **99.11%** | **99.13%** | **99.95%** | **27.6 s** | **738 MB** |

> **Final Kaggle results** (June 16, 2026): DeBERTa-v3 trained with focal loss (γ=2.0), FGM adversarial training (ε=0.5), curriculum learning (1 epoch), and VRAM-probed batch sizing on a dual T4 GPU setup. DistilBERT, ELECTRA, and RoBERTa were available as CLI alternatives but not executed in this run (--model DeBERTa-v3 was specified).

### 4.4 Ensemble Results

| Configuration | Accuracy | Spam F1 | ROC-AUC | Inference Time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Classical only (XGBoost) | 98.29% | 98.33% | 99.86% | ~3 ms |
| Transformer only (DeBERTa-v3) | 99.11% | 99.13% | 99.95% | ~50 ms |
| **Ensemble (XGBoost + DeBERTa-v3)** | **—** | **99.22%** | **—** | **~55 ms** |

**Fusion weight**: The optimal ensemble fusion weight is **w = 0.35**, determined by grid search (21 steps, 0.0–1.0) optimizing spam F1 on the holdout set. This gives 35% weight to the classical (XGBoost) branch and 65% weight to the transformer (DeBERTa-v3) branch, reflecting DeBERTa-v3's stronger individual performance while retaining XGBoost's robustness on keyword-heavy spam.

### 4.5 Inference Performance Benchmarks

| Configuration | Batch=1 (ms) | Batch=10 (ms) | Batch=50 (ms) | Memory (MB) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Classical (XGBoost) | ~3 | ~15 | ~60 | ~2 |
| Transformer (DeBERTa-v3) | ~50 | ~250 | ~800 | ~738 |
| Ensemble (both) | ~55 | ~265 | ~815 | ~746 |

> **Note**: Inference benchmarks measured on a CPU-only Intel i7 machine. GPU inference reduces transformer latency to ~15 ms for single emails.

## 5. Engineering & Deployment

### 5.1 System Architecture

The system consists of three components:

1. **Chrome Extension** (Manifest V3): Gmail DOM parsing, UI overlay banners, popup scanning, options page
2. **FastAPI Backend**: REST API with 5-layer detection pipeline, feedback storage, retraining endpoint
3. **Training Pipeline**: 6-stage orchestrator for producing production artifacts

### 5.2 Security Hardening

| Feature | Implementation |
|---|---|
| API Authentication | `X-API-Key` header on mutation endpoints |
| Rate Limiting | 60 req/min per IP via SlowAPI |
| Model Integrity | SHA-256 with `hmac.compare_digest` |
| PII Redaction | 5 patterns at API boundary (email, phone, IP, SSN, credit card) |
| CORS Protection | Origin regex: extensions + localhost only |
| SQL Injection Prevention | Table name regex validation |

### 5.3 Deployment Options

- **Local Python**: `pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m uvicorn app.main:app`
- **Docker**: `docker compose up --build` (multi-stage, non-root user)
- **Docker + MySQL**: `docker compose --profile mysql up --build`
- **Production**: Gunicorn + Uvicorn behind nginx with HTTPS

### 5.4 Testing Infrastructure

- **225 tests**: 185 unit + 26 integration + 14 legacy
- **100% pass rate**, ~4 second execution time
- **Coverage**: All 14 production modules audited
- **2 production bugs discovered during test development**: `hashlib.compare_digest` (nonexistent function — SHA-256 verification never worked) and `SlowAPIMiddleware` (rate limiter never registered)

---

## 6. Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Defense in depth**: The 5-layer pipeline catches ~40-60% of emails before reaching the ML model. This reduces inference cost and makes predictions more interpretable for users. Layer 3 (rule-based) alone catches most obvious spam with explicit explanations.

2. **Dual-track ensemble**: Combining XGBoost with DeBERTa-v3 provides complementary strengths. XGBoost excels at pattern-matching spam (keyword density, structural features); DeBERTa-v3 excels at contextual phishing (natural language, social engineering). The ensemble reduces false positives on the boundary between aggressive marketing and actual phishing.

3. **Feature engineering matters for transformers**: Even with DeBERTa-v3's contextual understanding, the 32 meta-features (URL analysis, obfuscation detection, credential harvesting patterns) provide signals that transformers don't naturally extract from raw text — like detecting hidden HTML elements and Unicode homograph attacks.

4. **Testing drives design**: The 225-test suite not only verifies correctness but also serves as executable documentation. Two critical bugs were discovered during test development that would have gone undetected in production.

5. **PII redaction at the boundary**: Redacting PII at the API entry point (before any processing) ensures redacted data never reaches logs, feedback storage, or model training. This is simpler and more secure than trying to redact at multiple downstream points.

### What Didn't Work

1. **Single LogisticRegression baseline**: The v1.0 architecture used a single LogisticRegression model for all ML classification. On the 2,605-row dataset, accuracy was deceptively high (97.5%) because the model memorized dataset-specific patterns. On diverse real-world emails, performance degraded significantly.

2. **No checkpointing in v3.0 initial release**: The transformer training initially held `best_state` only in RAM. A 90-minute training run interrupted at 85 minutes would lose all progress. v3.0.1 added disk checkpoint persistence.

3. **API key as single shared secret**: The current auth model uses a single API key — suitable for single-user deployment but not for multi-tenant systems. JWT-based auth is on the roadmap for multi-user support.

### Surprising Findings

1. **Curriculum learning impact**: Starting with easy samples improved final F1 more than expected (~0.5-1%). The model appears to benefit from establishing a strong "anchor" understanding before encountering ambiguous cases.

2. **TF-IDF still competitive**: For keyword-heavy spam, the classical TF-IDF + XGBoost pipeline matches or exceeds transformer performance at 20× lower inference cost. The transformer's advantage is almost entirely on sophisticated phishing that uses natural language.

3. **Meta-feature importance**: Several meta-features (homograph hits, hidden element size, URL-to-text ratio) were top-10 features by XGBoost importance, validating the feature engineering investment. These are patterns that TF-IDF alone would miss.

---

## 7. Future Improvements

### Short-Term

- **Scheduled retraining**: Replace user-triggered retraining with a cron-based schedule or feedback-volume threshold
- **Model A/B testing**: Deploy multiple ensemble configurations and route traffic based on performance
- **CI/CD pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing, linting, and model evaluation on PRs

### Medium-Term

- **Model distillation**: Train a DistilBERT student from the DeBERTa-v3 teacher to reduce inference latency from ~50ms to ~15ms while retaining most accuracy
- **Multi-language support**: Expand phishing phrase libraries and train on multilingual datasets (currently English-only)
- **Gmail API integration**: Move from DOM parsing (fragile to Gmail UI changes) to Gmail API for reliable email extraction

### Long-Term

- **Real-time streaming**: Process incoming emails via Gmail push notifications rather than DOM observation
- **Federated feedback**: Aggregate feedback across deployments to improve the global model without sharing user data
- **Multi-modal detection**: Analyze embedded images, QR codes, and attachments for phishing indicators
- **Active learning**: Automatically identify low-confidence predictions for human review, focusing the feedback loop on the most valuable training samples

## 8. Conclusion

This project demonstrates that a dual-track ensemble of classical ML and transformer models, combined with layered deterministic detection, provides a robust and practical approach to spam and phishing detection. The architecture balances accuracy (deep learning for sophisticated attacks), speed (classical ML for obvious spam), and explainability (rule-based layers for transparent decisions). The production-grade engineering — Docker deployment, 225-test suite, SHA-256 integrity, PII redaction, and comprehensive documentation — makes this system deployable as a real-world tool and valuable as a reference architecture for ML engineering projects.

The system is actively maintained and open to contributions. Full experimental results from the Kaggle training run (June 16, 2026) are published in Section 4 above — 99.22% ensemble F1, 99.13% DeBERTa-v3 F1, 98.33% XGBoost F1 on the 342,178-row dataset.
